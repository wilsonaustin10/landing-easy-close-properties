### Recommendations for Further Improvement

To achieve ≥95 Performance score, consider:

1. **Server-Side Optimizations**
   - Enable HTTP/2 push for critical resources
   - Implement edge caching with Vercel Edge Functions
   - Use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for static pages

2. **Additional Client Optimizations**
   - Implement resource hints (preconnect, prefetch) more aggressively
   - Consider removing Google Maps from initial load (load on interaction)
   - Implement service worker for offline caching

3. **Infrastructure Changes**
   - Upgrade to Vercel Pro for better edge performance
   - Consider CDN for static assets
   - Implement Brotli compression at edge
